Technology:

This project is based on JavaEE(servlet, jsp, etc.)
The database structure in this program is simple, so there is no need to use Hibernate or Spring to manage the datasets. So I simply connected MySQL with this project.
MVC structure is used in this project. But again, since the structure is not complex, I didnâ€™t separate the interface and implemented class, instead, I set DAOs and Servlets as Classes directly.

Database:
1.	Used the number of products of each three fruits in some months to draw a bar chart.
2.	This dataset contained the id and prices of particular dates of items.
3.	Selected three kinds of items and stored the selling of them in some months and find out which item sold best in total.
4.	Store the fruit consumption of 10 groups of people in 2 areas.
5.	The consumption of banana and apple in 10 months.
6.	The total sale of 2 items(each) in a year(each month separately.)
